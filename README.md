# virolink

`virolink` is an R package for visualizing viral integration events in host
genomes. It helps users explore where viral sequences integrate, how integration
patterns differ across samples or methods, and how host breakpoints connect to
viral genomic positions.

The package focuses on visualization and exploratory evidence views. It does
not perform read alignment, integration calling, or automatic biological
interpretation.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("YuLab-SMU/virolink")
```

Load the package as:

```r
library(virolink)
```

## What virolink provides

`virolink` organizes viral-integration visualization around a practical
analysis workflow:

- standardize integration records into a consistent table structure;
- define host and virus genome coordinates explicitly;
- summarize integration burden across samples, cohorts, or detection methods;
- survey integration events across the host genome;
- compare host breakpoints with viral breakpoint positions;
- inspect local host genomic context around selected integration sites;
- visualize host-virus links in circular or linear layouts;
- build lightweight interactive HTML views for exploration.

## Input data

The core input is a tabular integration table with one row per integration
event. The standard columns are:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `host_chr` | host chromosome |
| `host_pos` | host breakpoint position |
| `virus_pos` | viral breakpoint position |
| `sample` | sample identifier |
| `support` | read support or another numeric evidence measure |
| `virus_strand` | viral strand orientation |
| `method` | detection method or evidence source |

Common aliases such as `chr`, `host_loc`, `viral_loc`, and `reads` are accepted
by the input helpers.

## Main user-facing functions

| Task | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| Standardize records | `read_integrations()`, `as_integrations()`, `validate_integrations()` |
| Define genomes and annotations | `host_genome()`, `virus_genome()`, `virus_features()`, `hbv_features()`, `host_features()` |
| Compare samples or cohorts | `plot_cohort_comparison()` |
| Survey host-genome distribution | `plot_integration_landscape()` |
| Compare host and virus breakpoints | `plot_breakpoint_map()` |
| Inspect local host context | `plot_locus_context()` |
| Summarize signature or clonality evidence | `plot_integration_signature()` |
| Build circular linked views | `plot_integrations()` with `track_*()` functions |
| Build linear linked views | `plot_linear_integrations()` |
| Explore interactively | `plot_interactive_explorer()` |

## Documentation

The runnable workflow and demonstration plots are provided in the package
vignette:

```r
vignette("virolink", package = "virolink")
```

The vignette uses the small example files bundled under `inst/extdata`, so it
can be run without downloading external genome resources.

## Development status

`virolink` is under active development. The current API is centered on
user-friendly visualization workflows for viral integration data, and additional
views may be added as the package evolves.
